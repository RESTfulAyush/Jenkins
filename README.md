# **Learning Repository**  

This repository is a **personal learning space** where I document and experiment with various **DevOps concepts, tools, and CI/CD pipelines**. The files here are **not meant for direct execution**, as they require additional setups like **Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, Docker, AWS, and other configurations**.  

## **Purpose of This Repository**  

The main goal of this repository is to:  
- Practice **Jenkins CI/CD Pipelines**  
- Integrate **SonarQube for Static Code Analysis**
- Integrate **Nexus repository for Artifact Storage**
- Work with **AWS ECS, ECR, and other cloud services**
## **What This Repository Contains**  

This repo will include:  
- **Jenkins Pipelines**: Configuration files for CI/CD automation  

## **Pre-requisites & Setup Requirements**  

⚠️ **This repository is NOT plug-and-play.** You need:  
- **Jenkins Setup** (with necessary plugins and credentials)  
- **SonarQube Server** for code analysis  
- **Docker & Kubernetes Configurations**  
- **Cloud Account** (AWS/GCP/Azure) if using cloud services  
- **Custom Credentials** for Nexus, AWS, Slack, or other integrations  



- All integrations (SonarQube, AWS, Nexus, etc.) require proper setup in **Jenkins Credentials Store**.
